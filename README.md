# 2021 FooBar with Google Challenge

## Introduction

If you don't know, FooBar with Google is a secret challenge used by Google to (sometimes) hire engineers. Since Google knows all, they invite developers that
match a certain profile based on their search history and browser fingerprint (I'd imagine, at least.) It's sort of secret, but well-know--and great fun. [Here's some more background about it.](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-hired-by-google-b19806ad3c62)

I recently got the opportunity to participate in its latest iteration, and as someone who doesn't consider herself one for code golf, Leetcode, and other code challenges I thought I'd blog about it from a DevOps/SRE perspective.
